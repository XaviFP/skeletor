Skeletor is a Backbone fork

Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface.

## Changes from Backbone

### Changes due to using Lodash instead of Underscore

1. Use `drop` instead of `rest`.
2. `indexBy` is called `keyBy`
2. Use `invokeMap` for collections instead of `invoke`.
